I wrote this on a saturday afternoon when I had an hour or two to kill. 

This module calculates for all numbers under 10.000 if they are 'perfect'. E.g. if the sum of the numbers they are fully dividable through is the exact sum of their own.

[ Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)itive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. Ïƒ1(n) = 2n.

The actual objective was to have an excercise in pytest and the writing of a very simple module. It was not the intention to write the fastest implementation.
